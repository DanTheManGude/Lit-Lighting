				A gel is a colored transparent plastic like material used to change the color of the light given off by a <a href="fixtures.shtml#Conventional">conventional fixture</a>.  Gels typically come in 3x3 feet sheets and can be cut to fit your desired fixture.  To use a gel you must place it in a gel frame that is suited for the fixture.  <a href="fixtures.shtml#Strip">Strip</a> lights used for cycs typically have diffrent gels in order to mix the colors.  Gels can be very useful when it comes to designing.

				A barn door is something to put on the front of <a href="fixtures.shtml#Fresnel">fresnel</a> to control where the light is thrown.  There are flaps on hinges which appear like doors of a barn that can be bent out to your liking.  Because of the wash nature of fresnels, barn doors can be very useful in containing light from one.  A barn door attaches to the same place the gel frame would go.

				Top hats shield the light from the audiences eyes.  Even if the focus is on stage, the lense from a fixture is visible to the audience can be distracting and looks sloppy.  Also, if a light is near the proscenium or something else that needs to be dark, a top hat can prevent spill over light from hitting it.  Top hats are attached using the same place a gel frame would go.

				To send data, a specialized 5 pin XLR cable is required.  DMX is the standard format the data is sent and can be interchanged with the term 'data'.  Many <a href="fixtures.shtml#Intelligent">intelligent fixtures</a> will be 3 pin, in which case an adapter from 5 pin to 3 pin is perfectly fine to use.  Be sure to use DMX lighting 3 pin and not sound XLR, as this may cause problems.  A Optical Isolator or Iso for short is a device that can be used as a hub of DMX.  There is an in which comes from the board and multiple outs tha can be used to send to fixtures in different directions.  Using a Y-splitter will cause problems in data transferring.  Fixtures will have a data in as well as data out which can be used for daisy chaining one fixture to another.  On the last fixture it is not required but is recommended to have a terminator on the data out to prevent uncontrollable flashes by the other fixtures.

The standard power plug used is stage pin and  virtually all raceways and <a href="fixtures.shtml#Conventional">conventional fixtures</a> use.  Extension cords in stage pin are available, but any extensions cords used should be as short as possible to reduce resistance. Adapters with stagepin and Edison are also prevalent.  Common amongst <a href="fixtures.shtml#Intelligent">intelligent fixtures</a> is a power port called powercon, and comes with a powercon to Edison adapter.  Many times there will be a powercon power out port on a fixture in oder to achieve a daisy chain of power.

    <h2 id="Modifier" class="firsth">Fixture Modifier</h2>
    <p>
      Fixture Modifiers are anything that can be attached to a fixture to
      enhance, change, or control the light given off by it.

    <h4 class="firsth" id="Gel">Gels and Gel Frames</h4>
    <div class="dropdownI">

        <div class="descI">Many color gels, some in gel frames</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      A gel is a colored transparent plastic like material used to change the
      color of the light given off by a
      <a href="fixtures.html#Conventional">conventional fixture</a>. Gels
      typically come in 3x3 feet sheets and can be cut to fit your desired
      fixture. To use a gel you must place it in a gel frame that is suited for
      the fixture. <a href="fixtures.html#Strip">Strip</a> lights used for cycs
      typically have diffrent gels in order to mix the colors. Gels can be very
      useful when it comes to designing.

        <div class="descI">metal gobo in a gobo holder</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Gobos are metal or glass disks that are cut out to form a shapes, images,
      or text. A gobo mus be placed in a gobo holder. A gobo holder can only be
      inserted into an
      <a href="fixtures.html#Ellipsoidal">ellipsoidal</a> towards the middle or
      gobos are built into some <a href="fixtures.html#Mover">movers</a>. There
      are companies that will create a custom gobo of your design.

    <h4 id="BarnDoor">Barn Door</h4>
    <div class="dropdownI">

        <div class="descI">typical Barn Door</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      A barn door is something to put on the front of
      <a href="fixtures.html#Fresnel">fresnel</a> to control where the light is
      thrown. There are flaps on hinges which appear like doors of a barn that
      can be bent out to your liking. Because of the wash nature of fresnels,
      barn doors can be very useful in containing light from one. A barn door
      attaches to the same place the gel frame would go.
    </p>
    <h4>Top Hat</h4>
    <div class="dropdownI">
      <img src="assets/images/tophat.jpg" alt="typical Top Hat" />

        <div class="descI">typical Top Hat</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Top hats shield the light from the audiences eyes. Even if the focus is on
      stage, the lense from a fixture is visible to the audience can be
      distracting and looks sloppy. Also, if a light is near the proscenium or
      something else that needs to be dark, a top hat can prevent spill over
      light from hitting it. Top hats are attached using the same place a gel
      frame would go.

    <h4 class="firsth" id="Data">Data Supply</h4>
    <div class="dropdownI">
      <img src="assets/images/data.jpg" alt="5 pin DMX cable" />
      <div class="dropdown-contentI">
        <img src="assets/images/data.jpg" alt="5 pin DMX cable" />
        <div class="descI">5 pin DMX cable</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      To send data, a specialized 5 pin XLR cable is required. DMX is the
      standard format the data is sent and can be interchanged with the term
      'data'. Many
      <a href="fixtures.html#Intelligent">intelligent fixtures</a> will be 3
      pin, in which case an adapter from 5 pin to 3 pin is perfectly fine to
      use. Be sure to use DMX lighting 3 pin and not sound XLR, as this may
      cause problems. A Optical Isolator or Iso for short is a device that can
      be used as a hub of DMX. There is an in which comes from the board and
      multiple outs tha can be used to send to fixtures in different directions.
      Using a Y-splitter will cause problems in data transferring. Fixtures will
      have a data in as well as data out which can be used for daisy chaining
      one fixture to another. On the last fixture it is not required but is
      recommended to have a terminator on the data out to prevent uncontrollable
      flashes by the other fixtures.

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      A strip of of power plugs is referred to as raceways. The standard power
      plug used is stage pin and virtually all raceways and
      <a href="fixtures.html#Conventional">conventional fixtures</a> use.
      Extension cords in stage pin are available, but any extensions cords used
      should be as short as possible to reduce resistance. Adapters with
      stagepin and Edison are also prevalent. Common amongst
      <a href="fixtures.html#Intelligent">intelligent fixtures</a> is a power
      port called powercon, and comes with a powercon to Edison adapter. Many
      times there will be a powercon power out port on a fixture in oder to
      achieve a daisy chain of power.

    <h4 id="Gaff">Gaff Tape</h4>

    </div>
    <p>
      Gaffers tape common referred to as Gaff tape can be used for an assortment
      of uses. Typically in black, it usually does not leave a sticky residue to
      the surface applied after removal. A common use is to tape down exposed
      cables to the floor in a neat fashion. It can also be used to tape
      together a gel frame. A good habit is to put a piece of tap an all of your
      <a href="fixtures.html#Intelligent">intelligent fixtures</a> and wright
      the address for easy reference. On
      <a href="controllers.html">boards</a> with several faders, a technique
      used to to place tape below all faders with a word or two describing what
      or where it controls.

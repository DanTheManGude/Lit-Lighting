        Please note that this site it no longer updated and to visit

        about me. </strong
      >My name is Daniel Gude and I am a first year student studying Software
      Engineering at RIT. During my 4 years of highschool I rigged, designed,
      and ran the lighting for my school. I worked on the annual chorus
      concerts, fall plays, and spring musicals as well as any other event
      occurring in the auditorium. I have had experience working on ETC's
      Express 48/96 board and the ETC ION. (Side note the ION runs the same
      software as the EOS Ti which is the most prevalent board used on Broadway)
      So far at RIT, I designed a theatre club's musical this past fall. Over
      the summer of 2016, I was employed by a Lighting and Sound company. In the
      weeks leading up to the highschool performances, I would be the first to
      arrive and leave hours after anyone else. Lighting is a passion of mine
      and I hope you can learn something from this page.

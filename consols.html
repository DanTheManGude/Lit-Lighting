      Preset boards typically have two sets of faders. The two sets are
      identical in terms of which dimmers are being controlled. Two separate
      fader acts as a master for each set, and you are able to switch from one
      look to another. Preset boards can be very useful for events where design
      is made on the fly.

      Memory boards can record multiple channel levels in cues and is the
      standard when working on theatrical productions. When recording a cue all
      the channel levels will be captured and can be called upon later by
      returning to that cue. Every lighting change can be recorded to make a new
      cue, and during performance the only required work is to hit the "Go"
      button. This eliminates much of human error. Older boards could have
      dozens of faders to control channel levels. Newer boards have a very
      sophisticated software and can include features such as intelligent
      fixtures controlled by one channel, touchscreen, and graphical GUI
      interface. Every board is different in some way, and be sure to read the
      manuel to learn about each feature and how to use it.

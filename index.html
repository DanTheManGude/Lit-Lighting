      Welcome to Dan Gude's Lit Lighting. This website is aimed towards people
      with little or no experience in stage lighting. There are links to
      diffrent aspects with information about each. To be successful when
      working with lighting it is imperative to have an understanding of all the
      diffrent components it is comprised of.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The beginning of lighting control starts at the
      <a href="consols.html">Board</a>. <a href="extras.html#Data">Data</a> is
      sent through 5 pin DMX cables to a dimmer rack and or DMX hubs. A dimmer
      rack interprets the data and gives power to specified circuits. A
      <a href="fixtures.html#Conventional">light</a> that is being powered from
      that specified circuit will be powered. Diffrent level of intensity can be
      specified from the board to allow for dimming. All circuits also known as
      dimmers have a number that the dimmer rack associate to each, and this is
      the number to use on the board. On the board side one or many dimmers also
      known as addresses can be assigned to a channel. For example, if we assign
      dimmer 5 to channel 1 and put channel 1 to 50% then the light plugged into
      to 5 will be at 50% of its max brightness.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      In addition, data can be sent to
      <a href="fixtures.html#Intelligent">intelligent lighting fixtures</a>.
      Intelligent lights are anything that is more than only power and will have
      a DMX port. In order to 'talk' to the fixture you must address it at a
      single number first on the fixture itself. From consol to consol, they
      will hangle intelligent fixtures differently. Each attribute of the
      intelligent fixture can be accessed by addresses in a similar fashion.
      Newer boards are able to keep one fixture to one channel using newer
      software, but in order to access each attribute on an older board you
      would have to use multiple channels. For example, let us use a mover with
      the paramaters of intensity, red, green, blue, pan, and tilt. We are going
      to address it at address 11. Back on the board, address 11 will controll
      the intensity, address 12 controls how red the beam will be, address 13
      controls how blue, and it continues until address 16 which controls tilt.
